<a href="https://nicobako.dev">nicobako.dev</a> is my personal site that is *still a work in progress* and, let's be honest, *a playground*.

<h2> Design</h2>

I'm trying something new here.

All my friends told me about is cool thing called _React_, and that *I just had to use it*, but what do they know?

Instead, I'm writing this with plain HTML, and a few other libraries.

If you're interested in seeing the source code take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/nicobako/nicobako.github.io">GitHub Repo for this site</a>.

<h3> <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a></h3>

I'm using <i>Tailwind</i> as a CSS framework since I like its concept of <i>atomic CSS</i>.

<h3> <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a></h3>

I'm using *htmx* for replacing content on pages to simulate an SPA.

<h3> <a href="https://hyperscript.org/">hyperscript</a></h3>

<p>
    Hyperscript plays very well with htmx and adds
    JavaScript-y functionality directly in HTML!
