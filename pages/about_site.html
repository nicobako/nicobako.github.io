<p>
    This personal site is more of a <i>playground</i> than a <em>professional personal site</em>.
</p>

<h2> Design</h2>

<p>
    I'm trying something new here.
    
    All my friends told me about is cool thing called <i>React</i>, and that <i>I just had to use it</i>, but what do they know?
    
</p>

<p>
    Instead, I'm writing this with plain HTML, and a few other libraries.

    My goal is to keep this as simple as possible, while not sacrificing functionality or quality.

</p>

<p>
    Another goal of this site is to build a <em>static site</em>
    using the same tools that I would use to build a <em>web application</em> using Django.
</p>

<h3> <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a></h3>

<p>
    I'm using <i>Tailwind</i> as a CSS framework since I like its concept of <i>atomic CSS</i>.
</p>

<h3> <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a></h3>

<p>
    I'm using <i>htmx</i> for replacing content on pages to simulate an SPA.
</p>

<h3> <a href="https://hyperscript.org/">hyperscript</a></h3>

<p>
    Hyperscript plays very well with htmx and adds
    JavaScript-y functionality directly in HTML!
