# About Nico

I'm a software developer with that loves writing *beautiful code*.

I have a firm belief that writing code is about more than *implementing features*. Writing code is a creative process that is equal parts art and science.

My principle goal, when writing code, is to create software that improves the lives of whoever interacts with it. This includes customers, other developers, and fo course, myself.
