    <header>About Me</header>

    <p>
        My name is Nico Bako.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have a firm belief that writing code is about much more than <em>implementing features</em>.
        Writing code is a creative process that is equal parts art and science.
    </p>

    <p>
        My principle goal, when writing code,
        is to create software that improves the lives of whoever interacts with it.
        This includes customers, other developers, and of course, myself.
