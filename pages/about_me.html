  <header>About Me</header>

  <p>My name is Nico Bako.</p>

  <p>
    I have a firm belief that writing code is about much more than
    <em>implementing features</em>. Writing code is a creative process that is
    equal parts art and science.
  </p>

  <p>
    My principle goal, when writing code, is to create software that improves
    the lives of whoever interacts with it. This includes customers, other
    developers, and of course, myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    As is evident from this website, I crave simplicity,
    and I don't particulary like flashy UIs. I want my code to be
    <em>functional</em> and <em>useful</em>.
