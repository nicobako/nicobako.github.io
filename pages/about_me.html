<h1>
    About Me
</h1>

<p>
    My name is Nico Bako.
</p>

<p>
    I'm a software developer with a passion for writing <i>beautiful code</i>.
</p>

<p>
    I have a firm belief that writing code is about more than <i>implementing features</i>.
    Writing code is a creative process that is equal parts art and science.
</p>

<p>
    My principle goal, when writing code, is to create software that improves the lives of whoever interacts with it.
    This includes customers, other developers, and of course, myself.
