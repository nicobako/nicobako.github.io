# [nicobako.dev](https://nicobako.dev)

[nicobako.dev](https://nicobako.dev) is my personal site that is *still a work in progress* and, let's be honest, *a playground*.

## Design

I'm trying something new here.

All my friends told me about is cool thing called _React_, and that *I just had to use it*, but what do they know...

Instead, I'm writing this with plain HTML... and a few other libraries.

If you're interested in seeing the source code take a look at the [GitHub Repo for this site](https://github.com/nicobako/nicobako.github.io).

### [md-block](https://md-block.verou.me/)

I'm using *md-block* for rendering *markdown*. Because I love *markdown* and *md-block* library is so easy to use!

### [htmx](https://htmx.org/)

I'm using *htmx* for replacing content on pages to simulate an SPA.

### [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/)

I'm using *Alpine.js* for all things *JavaScript-y* (i.e. interactivity)
when I don't want to write any *js* myself.

### Development

[Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
